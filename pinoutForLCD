VSS to any GND pin on the Pi.
VDD to any 5V pin on the Pi.
V0 to any GND pin on the Pi for maximum contrast. If you have a resistor around 1K-2K Ohms, you can connect V0 to GND through this resistor to reduce the contrast.
RS to GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 26).
RW to any GND pin on the Pi. (We're only writing to the display, not reading from it.)
E to another GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 19).
DB0-DB3 are not connected.
DB4 to another GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 13).
DB5 to another GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 6).
DB6 to another GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 5).
DB7 to another GPIO pin on the Pi (for example, GPIO 11).
LEDA to any 5V pin on the Pi through a 220-ohm resistor. This powers the backlight.
LEDK to any GND pin on the Pi.
